## ABOUT THE PROJECT 
<hr>
<br>
Summer Kindness Camp is an unreal project created for my PP1 with Code Institute.
Summer Kindness Camp is a project for children focused on helping them bring more kindness and love to those in need while participating in social programs for a week during the summer. Each day targets a different concern with multiple activities inside and outside the facilities in Zagreb, Croatia. 
The main goal of this project is for kids to get knowledge of social problems in the world and how they can make a difference even with a small gesture.

The social programs are: 

1. Senior's Program focuses on seniors living in nursing homes.

2. Protector's Program focuses on recycling and the environment.

3. Animal's Program focuses on abandoned pets living in shelters.

4. Cooking's Program focuses on people without homes.

5. Sport's Program focuses on kids living in an orphanage.

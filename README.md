## ABOUT THE PROJECT 

Summer Kindness Camp is an unreal project created for my PP1 with Code Institute.
Summer Kindness Camp is a project for children focused on helping them bring more kindness and love to those in need while participating in social programs for a week during the summer. Each day targets a different concern with multiple activities inside and outside the facilities in Zagreb, Croatia. 
The main goal of this project is for kids to get knowledge of social problems in the world and how they can make a difference even with a small gesture.

The social programs are: 

1. Senior's Program focuses on seniors living in nursing homes.

2. Protector's Program focuses on recycling and the environment.

3. Animal's Program focuses on abandoned pets living in shelters.

4. Cooking's Program focuses on people without homes.

5. Sport's Program focuses on kids living in an orphanage.

## DESIGNS

### IMAGES

The hero-image and the form's background have been chosen because they are joyful, bright, and colorful like the summer. They have colors in common that are used for the general style of the website without distracting the user and complementing themselves in a very playful way. 

### COLOR SCHEME

The color scheme is based on the two most significant images on the website (the hero image and the form image). The Safety Yellow, the Safety Orange Blaze Orange, and the Medium Aquamarine make a perfect match for bringing the website to life. The Ivory is for the body's background for a simple look, and the shade Rich Black FOGRA 39 is for the font.

### TYPOGRAPHY

Fonts 'Lato' and 'Sniglet' were imported from Google Fonts. 'Sniglet' is used in all the headings (h1, h2, and h3), table's caption, and the form's button because it looks informal but at the same time easy and unique.
'Lato' is used for the rest of the text because it is effortless to read.

    ## FEATURES

* ### CALL TO ACTION : 
   
   I made the call to action visible to get the user's attention.

    - For the navigation bar,  when the mouse hovers the word in the hamburger menu,  the color changes, but when it is on wider screens,  the word is underlined.

    - When the user focuses on any form input, the background's color changes, and for the "REQUEST INFO" button, the background's color changes when the mouse hovers over.

    - The background's color changes when the mouse hovers over the social media icons. 

    - The social media links open in a new tab for better UX.


 * ### NAVIGATION BAR

    A hamburger menu for small screens until 800px was created with CSS. It is shown in a column divided into sections. For bigger screens, the navigation bar changes into a horizontal display of the same areas in the same order: Home, About, Program, Gallery, and Contact. The navigation bar has a sticky position to avoid scrolling up and down.

* ### HOME SECTION

    This section features a hero image with the main title centered, and its shows in the same way in every screen size. The purpose of the hero image is to make an emotional impact on the user and make them stay longer.

* ### ABOUT SECTION
    This section features two parts: The first one has three cards with general information about the camp, and the second one, has the name of the reinforced values during the camp. Both parts are shown in rows for the wider screen, and they are in columns for small devices.     

<img src="documentation/about-section.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">

* ### PROGRAM SECTION

    This section also has two parts: The first one features five cards with each social Program and its explanation. Every title has an icon to add a little bit of fun, and in the top-right corner is the number of the day on which the activity is happening to give the user more information in a playful way.

    The second part features a table with the specific schedule of the "TYPICAL DAY" at the camp. It's divided into three columns: time, activity, and description. 

    The table's width changes for every screen size while maintaining its general structure.

* ### GALLERY SECTION

    This section features 12 photos arranged into one column for smaller devices (from 320px), two columns for medium devices (550px), and three for wider screens (from 1270px).

<img src="documentation/gallery-3-columns.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">

* ### CONTACT SECTION

    This section has a form for requesting more info, and it only asks the user: first name, last name, email address, and any comment or feedback. It's a short form to allow the user to give only the essential information he is willing to share. Every text field is required, so if any input is empty, it will ask to complete the blank space. Also, I added a placeholder to every empty input.

    The form has method= "post"  and action="https://formspree.io/f/xpzbqalv" for collecting data. Every user's data is sent to the selected email.
